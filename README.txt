A simple XKCD iphone app currently available on the app store

iTunes: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/xkcd-reader/id512726610?mt=8

Please, if you find the code useful, give the app a favourable rating, if you find the code absolutely useless and misleading, proceed and give it 1.star rating. :)

This was one of my first projects as an iOS developer, the code is somewhat unreadable but it works.

REQUIREMENTS

Restkit library - find it on http://www.restkit.org , follow the instructions here.

if you try to load the app without this library it will give you a clang error.

If you need some help, find me on twitter @twitter and i'll see if i can offer a hand.
